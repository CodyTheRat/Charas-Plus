# TODO

## Renderer
  @ Loads part data and renderers correctly.
  @ Can take individual poses on the sheet and animate.
  @ Interface with the builder and parts manager.

## Window
  @ Get frames working correctly.
  @ Figure out all needed elements.
  @ Renders and reacts to the preview renderer. # Maybe done? Not sure. Need to actually test.

## Builder
  @ Swaps parts out correctly.
  @ Stores image data in a non-absolutely-memory-hogging way. (strings?)

## Parts
  @ Palettes.
  @ Solution to shading, to allow for palettes (either grayscale tinting or something else)

## Saving
  @ Proper metadata, showing you who made the part, palette data, etc.
  @ Saves default palette.
  @ Saves characters into their own project file, as well as sheets.

@ Tons of other stuff that I don't even know yet.
  

# COMPLETED
